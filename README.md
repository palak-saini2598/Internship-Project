# My Summer Project 2025
Centralized Multi-Tech Automation Dashboard
This project is the capstone of my 6-week Summer Internship at LinuxWorld Informatics Pvt Ltd, where I designed and developed a multi-page Streamlit web application that unifies Cloud, AI/ML, DevOps, and Full-Stack utilities into a single, user-friendly platform.

✨Key Features
## Linux & Docker Command Runner
Securely execute Linux or Windows commands and manage Docker containers via SSH or local environment—directly from the browser.

## AI & Machine Learning Suite
Personal AI Chatbot & AI Agents
AI Disease Assistant
Machine Learning models for Salary Prediction, Titanic Survival, and Amazon Alexa Sentiment Analysis.

## Computer Vision Module
Real-time hand-gesture recognition using OpenCV + MediaPipe to launch apps (Notepad, Calculator, Paint, etc.).

## JavaScript & Full-Stack Tools
Web-based utilities such as WhatsApp messaging, email sender, GPS/location tracking, camera access, and a mini full-stack game suite.

## Cloud Integrations
AWS automation (EC2, S3, IAM, Lambda) and Docker container management for seamless deployment and scaling.

## Modern UI/UX
Theme-based Streamlit dashboard with animated navigation, responsive design, and smooth multi-page routing.

## Tech Stack
Frontend: Streamlit, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend / Logic: Python (Flask APIs for some modules)
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, TextBlob, Pandas, NumPy
AI & CV: Gemini API, OpenCV, MediaPipe
Cloud & DevOps: AWS (EC2, S3, IAM, Lambda), Docker, SSH
Database: MongoDB & MySQL (for selected utilities)
Version Control / CI-CD: GitHub, Jenkins (for pipeline experiments)

## Learning Outcomes
Integrated multiple domains—Cloud, AI/ML, DevOps, and Full-Stack—into a single production-ready application.
Built secure SSH workflows, modular page routing, and real-time data visualizations.
Gained hands-on experience in multi-technology orchestration, from system commands to advanced AI features.
